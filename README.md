# Linear-mixed-effect-modeling
Raw data and R code for performing linear mixed-effect modeling of vibratory tuning curve data

In the matlab datafile, variables d1 and d2 are the two cohorts presented as dataset 2 in the paper. Variables d3 and d4 are the two cohorts presented as dataset 1 in the paper. Sorry for putting these in reverse order!
